Step 1: Create Tensorflow folder name tensorflow09 under home directory ( make directory tensorflow09 first)
virtualenv --system-site-packages ~/tensorflow09
Step 2: Activate
source ~/tensorflow09/bin/activate

Step 3:
Find the version
curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow |xmllint --format - |grep whl


export TF_BINARY_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-0.9.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl
pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade $TF_BINARY_URL

Next Steps

After installing TensorFlow, validate the installation.

Note that you must activate the virtualenv environment each time you use TensorFlow. If the virtualenv environment is not currently active, invoke one of the following commands:

$ source ~/tensorflow/bin/activate      # bash, sh, ksh, or zsh
$ source ~/tensorflow/bin/activate.csh  # csh or tcsh
When the virtualenv environment is active, you may run TensorFlow programs from this shell. Your prompt will become the following to indicate that your tensorflow environment is active:

(tensorflow)$ 
When you are done using TensorFlow, you may deactivate the environment by invoking the deactivate function as follows:

(tensorflow)$ deactivate 
The prompt will revert back to your default prompt (as defined by the PS1 environment variable).
