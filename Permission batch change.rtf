To change all the directories to 755 (drwxr-xr-x):

find /opt/lampp/htdocs -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
To change all the files to 644 (-rw-r--r--):

find /opt/lampp/htdocs -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
chmod 644 {} \; specifies the command that will be executed by find for each file. 
{} is replaced by the file path, and the semicolon denotes the end of the command 
(escaped, otherwise it would be interpreted by the shell instead of find)
