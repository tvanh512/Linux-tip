sudo pip install --upgrade matplotlib
DEPRECATION: Uninstalling a distutils installed project (pyparsing) has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version. This is due to the fact that uninstalling a distutils project will only partially uninstall the project.
Solution:
sudo pip install --upgrade matplotlib  --ignore-installed pyparsing
